Simple, right?",

          "This talk will explore the conceptual underpinnings of asynchronous programming options, and the drawbacks and advantages to each. JS has supported callbacks since 2009, and as years have gone by it’s added support for promises, generators, and now async/await. On a surface level, each of these techniques seeks to answer a question of how to access data not immediately available, but a deeper look into how each works on a granular level will show their implementation differences and how these differences affect usage. We’ll also take a look at how intermediate values, and errors are affected by each method. I’ll walk through a series of scenarios so you can better visualize performance differences, and how each method propagates data through the stack and the event loop. Finally, I’ll talk about where the future of async may be headed. Armed with new knowledge from this deep dive, the potentially treacherous road to fully understanding async will hopefully become a smoother ride!",

          "In public school, we were required to go through peer mediation training to stem the tide of physical violence. As teens, we were given a space with no adults to work through conflicts with our peers through communication training, and it elevated the playing field for us needing to coexist, untrusting of outsiders to solve our problems. As the education community manager of Node.js, and now on the Moderation team, I’m implementing the conflict management training program for Node.js leadership and collaborators–those who keep the project ticking for millions of users of the project. In tech, we don’t include the experts that are needed to solve these problems and we desperately need them–so we’re doing just that. We’ll walk through applying this education to OSS developers distributed across the globe, and report on how this can remove barriers to stability for projects through improving development productivity with healthy communication and collaboration–peer conflict management.",
